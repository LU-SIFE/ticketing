# hack your bureaucracy
### ðŸŸ¡ (Taken)

- online blog

- "Hi Derrek and team! I have 3 possible different projects for this. 1: I need a second page of the existing website made that is a list of extra links / images referenced in the book. (So a new "page" on the existing site with text and links, which I have in Google Doc.) This should be straightforward. 2: I actually think this website is over-engineered (it requires Docker and Gatsby etc) and would love to move the current design to Squarespace. 3: Squarespace would solve for this, but we're currently using Medium for the blog which robs us of the ability to monitor/control SEO, etc so I'd love to restart the blog on Squarespace."
