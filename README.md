# Web Dev Ticketing

This repository is an example of what the ticketing system could look like. The below links take you to each project available.

For information on how this repository is supposed to be used, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LU-SIFE/Web-Dev-Ticketing/wiki).

When a project is ready to be worked on, this README page can & will be updated to reflect which projects are available, and which are taken, and by whom.

New projects can be added by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/LU-SIFE/Web-Dev-Ticketing/issues/1), which is quickly reviewed, and then the details of the new project is posted to the README. These can be opened by anyone.

Students can also use or open issues to discuss problems they are having with a specific project.

>(If anyone has any github workflows experience, it would be greatly appreciated, I am working on a self-updating README, and it would be EXTREMELY helpful lol, shoot me an email, or open a new issue and mention me or something.)

Project #1 is an example project, I will use this ticketing system as an example.
