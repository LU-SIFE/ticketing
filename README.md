# Web Dev Ticketing

This repository is an example of what the ticketing system could look like. The below links take you to each project available.

When a project is ready to be worked on, this README page can & will be updated to reflect which projects are available, and which are taken, and by whom.

New projects can be added by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/LU-SIFE/Web-Dev-Ticketing/issues/1), which is quickly reviewed, and then the details of the new project is posted to the README. These can be opened by anyone.

We can have several people review the new issues/projects, and maybe automate this process later on, and a general checklist of code/push reviews can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/LU-SIFE/Web-Dev-Ticketing/wiki) section.

Project #1 is an example project, I will use this ticketing system as an example.

I'm unsure what will happen to projects after they are completed, they may not be touched, archived, or outright removed.

Maybe a program will be developed to interface with this README, to make new project addition easier.

The Wiki feature can also be used for each individual project, and maybe leave a [scrumblr.ca](http://scrumblr.ca/) link for each team.

The [Discussions](https://github.com/LU-SIFE/Web-Dev-Ticketing/discussions) page can be used for students to converse, generate ideas, hold polls, ask questions, and show off work to other students.

The only issue I have with this github solution, is the effort it takes to edit this README. Opening the raw code for this and adding onto it can be a pain sometimes, and there is no automation at all.

It may be a good opportunity for students to become familiar with github and some of it's properties.

The general Markdown formatting for new entries is as follows:

```
## Project Name
### :green_circle: (AVAILABLE)

> - Time Frame
>
> - About the Business
>
> - Description/General Project Scope
>
> - Contact Info (?)

---
```

When a project is ready to be taken on by a group, line 2 would be changed to the following:
```
### :red_circle: (TAKEN BY [@USER1](user_profile_url), [@USER2](user2_profile_url))
```
and the following lines should be added to the project entry:
```
>
> - [Link to Github Repository/Project](Link goes here)
```
