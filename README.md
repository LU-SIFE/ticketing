# Web-Dev-Ticketing

This repository is an example of what the ticketing system could look like. The below links take you to each project available.

When a project is ready to be worked on, this README page can & will be updated to reflect which projects are available, and which are taken, and by whom.

New projects can be added by opening a new issue, which is quickly reviewed, and then the details of the new project is posted to the README.
