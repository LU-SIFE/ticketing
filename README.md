# Web-Dev-Ticketing

This repository is an example of what the ticketing system could look like. The below links take you to each project available.

When a project is ready to be worked on, this README page can & will be updated to reflect which projects are available, and which are taken, and by whom.

New projects can be added by opening a new issue, which is quickly reviewed, and then the details of the new project is posted to the README. These can be opened by anyone.

We can have several people review the new issues/projects, 

Project #1 is an example project, I will use this ticketing system as an example.

I'm unsure what will happen to projects after they are completed, they may not be touched, archived, or outright removed.

The general Markdown formatting for new entries is as follows:

```
## Project Name
### :green_circle: (AVAILABLE)

> - Time Frame
>
> - About the Business
>
> - Description/General Project Scope
>
> - Contact Info (?)
```
